LessLib is a collection of mixins for Less.

The goal is to equalize every different css property across as many
browsers as possible. This will assist in eliminating the tedious
work involved in updating different vendor prefixes for css3 and 
make it easy to create cross-browser compatible styles.

Stretch goals for this library will be built in layout reversing
methods that will assist in automatically internationalizing 
websites. (e.g. setting vars for left/right/ltr/rtl and swapping
them for margin-left, margin-right, padding-left, padding-right, 
left, right, direction, floats, etc...
